# The Agentic Paradigm

Traditionally, testing is focussed on ensuring the pipelines of the factory works correctly.

It does not focus on the quality of content produced.

> Logging/tracing, rather than unit and integration tests, are of more value here. It can often be a challenge to create tests for Agentic Systems based on agentic pipelines being different to tradional ones.

Below we can see how tracing/logging is part of the development process that will assist the developer and end user.

## Evaluation Driven Development

If we consider our whole app to be a molecule based on a number of atoms, we use EDD to build in evaluations so that development and production can benefit from immediate feedback.
