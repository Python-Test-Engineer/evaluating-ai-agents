# PyTest Full Stack

When I was studying/wroking with PyTest, I came across a great many resources, yet each was not complete.

I put together a template for PyTest Full Stack that enabled developers to drop thier app in `src` and have a complete PyTest Full Stack suite to test from DB schema all the way through API and E2E testing.

It contains around 200 template tests that are ready to go.

I published the manual at [https://pytest-cookbook.com/](https://pytest-cookbook.com and the repo at [https://github.com/Python-Test-Engineer/PyTest-Full-Stack](https://github.com/Python-Test-Engineer/PyTest-Full-Stack).

It had HTML, Coverage and its own CSV custom reporting built in as well as some plugins for console formatting.

I gave a workshop 'Getting started with PyTest' at PyCon Ireland in November 2024.

This can then be used as a full QA testing of an application.
