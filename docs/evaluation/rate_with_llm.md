# LLM as judge

The technique of an (untested) LLm generating question/answer pairs to act as ground truths to then test an LLM seems illogical but current thinking states this is quite effective.

This technique might be used by developers to improve the knowledge system as they work on it rather than getting human evaluations at every step.

This is more of a development tool rather than final evalauation.
