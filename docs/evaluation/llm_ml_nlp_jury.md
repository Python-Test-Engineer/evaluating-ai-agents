# Jury

We can have a panel of judges to create a final decision in one of many ways or use a Final Judge that reviews all the opinions of judges and forms a final decision.

We can use ML and NLP as judges and not just LLMs.

Building specialist judges to rate and give reason for various qualitative metrics like bias, conciseness, usefulness etc can create reusable judges.
