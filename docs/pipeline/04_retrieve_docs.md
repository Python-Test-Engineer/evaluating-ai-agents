# Query

With our retrieved documents and the user question, we can now add them to one of Promtpt Templates to send to the LLM to generate a response.

We will have a number of Prompt Templates and when the user finally rates the response, we will be able to record which template, as well as all the other strategy parameters, enabling us to refine our system.

This is where PROMPT ENGINEERING comes into play.

We can ask the LLM to improve on the response by resubmitting the query with a request to improve it.
