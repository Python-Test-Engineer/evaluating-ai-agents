# Services provided

### Backend Pythonista and Test Automation Engineer

## Skillset

Primarily:

- Python
- PyTest
- Playwright
- Django

Tools:

I strive to dive deeper into these tools and see them as programming languages in their own right. DevOps seems to be an essential part of my work:

- Shell Scripting
- Git/GitHub Actions
- Docker

## Engagement Style

I offer on-demand, freelance services starting from 1/2 day blocks.

*As and when you need it...*

Tech is a way of life for me not just a job and I strive to have enthusiasm and passion for the projects I work on. Professional fulfilment is paramount.


## Eligibility

- UK National
- Fluent English

## On-site/Hybrid

I am based in Brighton and enjoy (local) on-site work as well as working from my home office.

## Volunteer Coach

I am a volunteer coach with [Codebar Brighton](https://codebar.io/brighton).

## YouTube

I produce a large amount of content that is associated with a repo that enables 'out of the box' ease of use.

If I find good videos without a repo, I often create a repo and my own video with reference to the source video. I have no commercial interest in this matter.

## Outside of tech...

I enjoy working in community kitchens and love laughter, creating, doing and trying to work out why things are funny.
