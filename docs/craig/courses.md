The course [Udemy Hooks and Plugins course](https://www.udemy.com/course/pytest-cookbook-using-hooks-to-create-custom-plugins/) has just been published and Udemy has a sale ever two weeks and the cost would be $20 USD approx.

I am currently developing two courses:

- Python - mock, patch and monkeypatch.
- PyTest Django Full Stack - a DB <-> E2E testing of a generic ecommerce store.

The aim is to make them generic, ready to go templates, that also dive deeper into aspects of Python.

I am of the opinion that as developers we do not need to reinvent the wheel - it has (almost) all been done before - and that we should be free to use our creativity to build great proucts.

The type of course I would want...
