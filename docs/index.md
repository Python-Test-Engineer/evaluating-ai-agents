# The Agentic Paradigm

Traditionally, testing is focussed on ensuring the pipelines of the factory works correctly.

It does not focus on the quality of content produced.

In Agentic Systems, we obviously care about correctly working pipelines, but evaluating the content for substance and quality is of more importance.

We thus need monitoring which embraces testing and evaluation.

Logging/tracing, rather than unit and integration tests, are of more value here. It can often be a challenge to create tests for Agentic Systems based on agentic pipelines being different to tradional ones.

As we build each Agentic Component - be it a function, tool or agent - we can log the necessary information and if we add a ground truth or reference, we will have our dataset for anlaysis.

This will be in continous, in next to real time and 'actual'.

Below we can see how tracing/logging is part of the development process that will assist the developer and end user.
